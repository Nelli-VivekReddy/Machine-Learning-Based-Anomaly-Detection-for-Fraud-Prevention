# Machine-Learning-Based-Anomaly-Detection-for-Fraud-Prevention
This project detects fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning. A Logistic Regression model is trained on a Kaggle dataset achieving 94% accuracy. A Streamlit web app will provide real-time fraud prediction, helping prevent cyber fraud effectively.

This project aims to detect fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning algorithms.
Currently, 30% of the project is complete with testing on logistic regression.further models will be tested and compared

Progress So Far
- Collected and explored dataset from Kaggle
- Preprocessed and trained Logistic Regression model
- Achieved 94% accuracy and high recall
- Evaluated with confusion matrix, ROC-AUC
- Planned Streamlit web app for real-time prediction

## Next Steps
-analyse different machine learning methods and come for a conclusion
- Complete data preprocessing pipeline
- Build Streamlit UI
- Deploy model for real-time predictions

## Tech Stack
- Python, pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
- Google Colab for development
- Streamlit (planned)
